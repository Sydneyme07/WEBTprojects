        <h1>Why is 24 Hours Enough?</h1>
        <p>Have you ever been burnt out? In need of a reset, but work is busy and you dont have enough
           PTO for a full vacation? Or maybe your bank account is silently protesting. Travel doesn't 
           always mean a long getaway. Sometimes, 24 hours is all you need. A single day away can provide
           a much needed recharge without overplanning or breaking the bank.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Take a Daycation</h2>
        <p>Planning is the first step to a successful day. Start by choosing a destination. Think short
            flights, train rides, or drives under 2 hours long. Bring only the necessities and use time
            saving options such as TSA Precheck to make your travel more efficient. Keeping the logistics
            simple allows you to enjoy the experience rather than stressing over the details. Now that
            the basics are taken care of, focus on being present and making the most of your day.</p>
        <h3>Carpe Diem: Intentional Travel</h3>
        <p>Intentional travel means choosing experiences and sights that are meaningful to you rather than
            trying to see everything at once. Focus on a few main highlights and remember to enjoy the
            moment. Stop at that cute cafe on the way to your destination. Ask your Uber driver for the
            best Italian restaurant in town. What matters most is making your time meaningful.
