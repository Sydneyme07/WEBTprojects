  <h2>24-Hour Packing Essentials</h2>

  <p>
    Packing for a 24-hour trip should be simple and efficient.
    The goal is to bring only what you truly need so you can move easily and save time.
    A backpack or small duffel bag is usually enough for an overnight getaway.
    Avoid checking bags when possible so you are not stuck waiting at baggage claim.
    Choosing versatile items helps reduce the number of things you need to pack.
    With a well-planned bag, short trips can feel stress-free and organized.
